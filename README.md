This is a svelte hello world application bootstrapped from their docs.

I've done some (very minor) changes and added a CI pipeline with fly.io as part of an excercise for a course on devops i am taking. 
Whoever is reading this, I don't know why or if this repository will have any value to you. Yet here we are. Have fun.
You find the deployed app [here](https://hello-svelte42069.fly.dev/)
